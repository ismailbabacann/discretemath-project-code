# Twin Primes Analysis

We compiled the codes of the tables used in the project we developed for the Discrete Mathematics II course.
This document explains six different Python programs for analyzing twin primes, their properties, and counts.

Contents
1. Basic Twin Primes Finder: Identifies twin primes up to a specified limit using a classical algorithm.
2. Formatted Twin Primes Table: Creates a structured table of twin primes and their ranks.
3. Range-Based Twin Primes: Finds twin primes within a specific range using the 6n Â± 1 formula.
4. Sieve of Eratosthenes: Counts twin primes efficiently using a prime sieve.
5. Performance Comparison: Analyzes execution time for finding twin primes at various limits.
6. Large-Scale Twin Primes: Calculates counts and percentages of twin primes up to extremely large values.

Usage
- Each script can be run independently.
- Modify input values like `limit` or `range` directly in the code.

Output
- Results are displayed in tabular format in the console.
- Some scripts can save results to text files for analysis in future.
